- Add ESLint for order of imports
- Better tsproofing overall - for exapmle it won't tell me about the .electron. issues - it suggests Electron but that's not a valid type
- Verify loaded files were not already compressed - Ask Claude perhaps it knows the exact properties to check for
- Before and after comparison popup for after conversion 
- Include ffmpeg binaries in build:win

Important measurements:
  a 15 seconds video:
    preset 6 1 minute 182mb to 40.7mb
    preset 4 2 minutes 182mb to 35.6mb
    x2 more time and 1.15 less size

  3 seconds video: 
    preset 4 30 seconds 20.3mb to 646kb with lanczos
    preset 4 1 minute 20.3mb to 1.76mb without lanczos
    preset 6 15 seconds 20.3mb to 763kb with lanczos
    x2 more time and 1.2 less size

  Note that these are relative not absolute values, I think 4 is a good fit for now. 
  It's also recommended by several AI assistants. 

  Note that without lanczos it takes about twice the time since there are more pixels to process. 
  It makes sense since 1080p is about twice lower than 4k. The size difference is also twice...
  Use lanczos!
